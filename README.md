# wsl-mlops-4ds1

**A portfolio of data science projects showcasing machine learning, data analysis, and visualization skills.**

## Overview

This repository contains projects and resources developed for the Data Science Engineering track at ESPRIT. Each project demonstrates practical applications of ML, data preprocessing, MLOps best practices, and effective reporting.

## Contents

- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: End-to-end workflows for supervised and unsupervised tasks
- **Data Analysis Notebooks**: Exploratory data analysis and insights visualizations
- **MLOps Templates**: Modular code for CI/CD, environment management, and automation
- **Sample Projects**: Example use cases in healthcare, web, and business domains

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:azizmessaoud/wsl-mlops-4ds1.git

# Install requirements (example for Python projects)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run main notebook or script
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
# or
python main.py
```

## MLOps Setup

- Step 1: **Add SSH Key to GitHub**
    - Generate an SSH key and add it to your account for secure access.
- Step 2: **Environment Setup**
    - Use `venv`, `conda`, or Docker for isolated reproducible environments.
- Step 3: **Code Quality & Testing**
    - Run linting and security checks (`black`, `pylint`, `bandit`).
    - Execute automated tests (`pytest`).
